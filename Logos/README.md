### How to use our logos
Where possible use the appropriate vector (.svg) logo:

<img src="AMYBO logo - black for very light backgrounds.svg" style="width:20%;" alt="Logo for white backgrounds">

[for white backgrounds](AMYBO%20logo%20-%20black%20for%20very%20light%20backgrounds.svg) or

<img src="AMYBO logo - black for very dark backgrounds.svg" style="width:20%;" alt="Logo for black backgrounds">

and ensure they get at least as much clear space as the "with clear space.png" logos.
### Why are SVGs best?
The svg's are the smallest file-size, yet also higher quality as they are infinitely scaleable.  
Smaller files = lower carbon.  
### Why is clear space required?
Clear space ensures our logo remains visually distinct, prevents clutter, and maintains its impact by avoiding interference from other elements.
### Why wasn't clear space added to the SVGs?
Often organisations requesting logos add clear space themselves (example: https://www.ibioic.com/about/#industry-members).
