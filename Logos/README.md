### How to use our logos
Where possible use the appropriate vector (.svg) logo:

<img src="AMYBO logo - white for very dark backgrounds.svg" style="width:20%;" alt="Logo for black backgrounds">

for black backgrounds, or

<img src="AMYBO logo - black for very light backgrounds.svg" style="width:20%;" alt="Logo for white backgrounds">

for white backgrounds, and ensure they get at least as much clear space as the ["with clear space.png"](AMYBO%20logo%20-%20black%20on%20white%20with%20clear%20space.png) logos.
### Why are SVGs best?
The svg's are the smallest file-size, yet also higher quality as they are infinitely scaleable.  
Smaller files = lower carbon.  
### Why is clear space required?
Clear space ensures our logo remains visually distinct, prevents clutter, and maintains its impact by avoiding interference from other elements.
### Why wasn't clear space added to the SVGs?
Often organisations requesting logos add clear space themselves - if we add extra clear space it only makes our logo look small compared with orgs that don't (example: https://www.ibioic.com/about/#industry-members).
### Is the logo AMYBO's only brand asset?
Not at all, have a look at the [Main README](../README.md)
