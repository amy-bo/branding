## Logos
### How to use our logos
Where possible use the vector (.svg) logos and ensure they get at least as much clear space as the "with clear space.png" logos.
### Why are SVGs best?
The svg's are the smallest file-size, yet also higher quality as they are infinitely scaleable.  
Smaller files = lower carbon.  
### Why is clear space required?
Clear space ensures our logo remains visually distinct, prevents clutter, and maintains its impact by avoiding interference from other elements.
### Why wasn't clear space added to the SVGs?
Often organisations requesting logos add clear space themselves (example: https://www.ibioic.com/about/#industry-members).
## Colours
- black #000
- blue #008BD2
- green #87BD25
## Fonts
[Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat) Semibold is used in both the logo and printed strap line, but downloading fonts increases website carbon footprint, so system fonts (font-family: Arial, sans-serif;) are preferred for web use.
## Banners
A pop-up roller banner for UK conferences is currently stored in [Martin's](https://amy.bo/Martin-links) studio.  
Various other banners have been made to the specifications of conference organisers social media platforms, etc.
