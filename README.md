## Logos
### How to use our logos
Where possible use the appropriate vector (.svg) logo:

<img src="Logos/AMYBO logo - white for very dark backgrounds.svg" style="width:20%;" alt="Logo for black backgrounds">

for black backgrounds, or

<img src="Logos/AMYBO logo - black for very light backgrounds.svg" style="width:20%;" alt="Logo for white backgrounds">

for white backgrounds, and ensure they get at least as much clear space as the ["with clear space.png"](Logos/AMYBO%20logo%20-%20black%20on%20white%20with%20clear%20space.png) logos.  All is explained in the [Logos README](Logos/README.md)
## Colours
- black #000
- blue #008BD2
- green #87BD25
## Fonts
[Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat) Semibold is used in both the logo and printed strap line, but downloading fonts increases website carbon footprint, so system fonts (font-family: Arial, sans-serif;) are preferred for web use.
## Strapline
<span style="color:#008BD2">Sustainable Protein for</span> <span style="#87BD25">All</span> 
- colour Sustainable Protein for #008BD2 and All #87BD25
- use font-family: Arial, sans-serif; for web or [Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat) for print/PDF (with embedded fonts).

```html
<span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">
  <span style="color:#008BD2;">Sustainable Protein for</span>
  <span style="color:#87BD25;"> All</span>
</span>
```

## Banners 
Various [digital banners](Other%20branding/Digital%20Banners) have been made to the specifications of conference organisers social media platforms, etc.
A [pop-up roller banner](Other%20branding/Physical%20Collateral/Pop-up%20Roller%20Banner) for UK conferences is currently stored in [Martin's](https://amy.bo/Martin-links) studio.
## Photos
We also have various photos for use with AMYBO projects in the [photos folder](Other%20branding/Photos) - please downsize appropriately for online use to minimise carbon footprint.
## Website
[amy.bo](https://amy.bo) currently redirects to [amybo.org](https://amybo.org)
The website will soon be transitioning from Hugo to Astro, the design is being [wireframed on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/WFobqScCnK3KAXzl2dpiMp/AMYBO?node-id=0-1&t=4VA0FJBiita2qoZT-1) and [discussed in the forum](https://forum.amybo.org/t/website-refresh/132)
