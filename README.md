## How to use our logos
Where possible use the vector (.svg) logos and ensure they get at least as much clear space as the "with clear space.png" logos.
## Why are SVGs best?
The svg's are the smallest file-size, yet also higher quality as they are infinitely scaleable.  
Smaller files = lower carbon.  
## Why is clear space required?
Clear space ensures our logo remains visually distinct, prevents clutter, and maintains its impact by avoiding interference from other elements.
## Why wasn't clear space added to the SVGs?
Often organisations requesting logos add clear space themselves (example: https://www.ibioic.com/about/#industry-members).
## What if I need something different?
Raise [an issue](https://github.com/amy-bo/branding/issues) and if it's urgent reach out to [Martin](https://amy.bo/Martin-links).
