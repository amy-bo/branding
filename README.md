## Logos
### How to use our logos
Where possible use the appropriate vector (.svg) logo:

<img src="Logos/AMYBO logo - white for very dark backgrounds.svg" style="width:20%;" alt="Logo for black backgrounds">

for black backgrounds, or

<img src="Logos/AMYBO logo - black for very light backgrounds.svg" style="width:20%;" alt="Logo for white backgrounds">

for white backgrounds, and ensure they get at least as much clear space as the "with clear space.png" logos.  All is explained in the [Logos README](Logos/README.md)
## Colours
- black #000
- blue #008BD2
- green #87BD25
## Fonts
[Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat) Semibold is used in both the logo and printed strap line, but downloading fonts increases website carbon footprint, so system fonts (font-family: Arial, sans-serif;) are preferred for web use.
## Strapline
<span style="color:#008BD2">Sustainable Protein for</span> <span style="#87BD25">All</span> 
- colour Sustainable Protein for #008BD2 and All #87BD25
- use font-family: Arial, sans-serif; for web or [Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat) for print/PDF (with embedded fonts).

```html
<span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">
  <span style="color:#008BD2;">Sustainable Protein for</span>
  <span style="color:#87BD25;"> All</span>
</span>
```

## Banners
