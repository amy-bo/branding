## Logos
### How to use our logos
Where possible use the appropriate vector (.svg) logo [for white backgrounds](Logos/AMYBO%20logo%20-%20black%20for%20very%20light%20backgrounds.svg) or [for black backgrounds](Logos/AMYBO%20logo%20-%20white%20for%20very%20dark%20backgrounds.svg) and ensure they get at least as much clear space as the "with clear space.png" logos.  All is explained in the [Logos README](Logos/README.md)
## Colours
- black #000
- blue #008BD2
- green #87BD25
## Fonts
[Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat) Semibold is used in both the logo and printed strap line, but downloading fonts increases website carbon footprint, so system fonts (font-family: Arial, sans-serif;) are preferred for web use.
## Banners 
Various [digital banners](Other%20branding/Digital%20Banners) have been made to the specifications of conference organisers social media platforms, etc.
A [pop-up roller banner](Other%20branding/Physical%20Collateral/Pop-up%20Roller%20Banner) for UK conferences is currently stored in [Martin's](https://amy.bo/Martin-links) studio.
